PoE Clerk is a userscript intended to provide additional functionality to the popular Path of Exile community trading site poe.trade.

Currently, PoE Clerk is limited to a shopping cart, accessible in a sidebar, that lets you save items for future reference and viewing.
You can resize the sidebar using the handle at its bottom right.

Some example screenshots are in the screenshots/ directory if you're curious about how PoE Clerk looks.

PoE Clerk is compatible with the Dark poe.trade theme (and none other).
