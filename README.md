PoE Clerk is a userscript intended to provide additional functionality to the popular Path of Exile community trading site poe.trade.

Currently, PoE Clerk is limited to a shopping cart, accessible in a sidebar, that lets you save items for future reference and viewing.

You can resize the sidebar using the handle at its bottom right.

PoE Clerk is compatible with both the List and Tiles views, but Modern Dark is the only compatible theme.
